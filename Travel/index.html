            <p>Travelling plays an important part in making us feel relaxed and rejuvenated. It also brings positive changes in our life and keeps us alive and active. Travelling gives us practical experience of things we have studied in the books and surfed on the internet. So a person who does not travel at all does not find any meaning in the name of India Gate or Ganga River. However, if he has travelled to these places, he can truly relate everything he has studied and will always remember each and every detail of that place.Nowadays, many people like travelling as they want to explore the world and watch everything they have read about. And this seems to be quite justified as practical knowledge is way more essential and effective than the theoretical one. People like to visit historical places present in different parts of the world and gather information on the same to write books and stories.Nowadays, many people like travelling as they want to explore the world and watch everything they have read about.

            <p>Foreign travelling for higher education is must these days as competition in the field of education has increased, and one needs to be physically present in order to assess the competition he is dealing with. It sharpens overall growth and adds practical knowledge which cannot be attained through only books. In fact, those who spend more time on travelling have a broader view of life because they tend to be more independent, which is very important for academic study and research</p>
